## What is Stride?


Stride is a blockchain ("zone") that provides liquidity for staked assets. Using Stride, you can earn *both* staking *and* DeFi yields across the Cosmos IBC ecosystem. Read our ["Meet Stride" blog post](https://stride.zone/blog/meet-stride) to learn more about why we built Stride. 

**Stride** is built using Cosmos SDK and Tendermint and created with [Ignite](https://ignite.com/). Stride allows users to liquid stake any IBC-compatible cosmos SDK native appchain token. Under the hood, Stride leverages the [Inter-Blockchain Communication protocol](https://ibc.cosmos.network/), [Interchain Accounts](https://blog.cosmos.network/interchain-accounts-take-cosmos-interoperability-to-the-next-level-39c9a8aad4ad) and [Interchain Queries](https://github.com/schnetzlerjoe/interchain-query-spec).
